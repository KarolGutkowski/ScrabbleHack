# ScrabbleHack
Early version of ScrabbleHack app.
This app is supposed to help you win scrabble games 
by suggesting best words to place with given letters at every moment of the game.

This app is only being made as a proving ground for my ability to make such a project
and should not be used in any scrabble competitions nor in family games if participants didn't
approve of it.

Later versions of app will include support for MacOs and Linux systems and also a GUI
very advanced version of app will use computer vision to recognize board and players letters to
automatize proccess of suggesting best words (there's also a possibility that this app will get
it's android or IOS version).
